#  Workspace Scheduler Web App
FGCU Senior Software Engineering Project <br>
Sponsor: CallMiner
## Project Details
An implementation of a hot desk/hoteling scheduler application that will allow employees to reserve desks and other workspaces, in a hybrid work environment. This will allow the company to focus resources on workspaces that are being used, and overall save money in overhead operating fees. It will also help employees to work more efficiently together by allowing them to see who will be in the office.
